Let's see how @propObject() decorator fulfil the need.

<div component="app-code" key="propObject-add-component"></div> 
Next, we need to write html code.
<div component="app-code" key="propObject-add-html"></div> 
<div component="app-propObject-add" title="propObject Decorator for add Example"></div>
